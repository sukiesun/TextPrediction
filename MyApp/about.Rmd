This app is made to predict the next word like what a smart keyboard does as the Coursera Data Science Capstone project.

SwiftKey is the project partner.

The app dictionary is created by the provided English data sets containing blogs, news and twitter files.

The basic idea is cleaning the data sets and tokenizing them into ngram models to build the prediction algorithm.
