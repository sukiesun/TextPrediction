This app is made to predict the next word like what a smart keyboard does as the Coursera Data Science Capstone project.

SwiftKey is the project partber.

The app dictionary is created by the provided English data sets containing blogs, news and twitters.

The basic idea is using the ngrams model to build the prediction algorithm.
